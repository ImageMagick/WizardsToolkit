This file documents how to use the binary distribution packages
built by ImageMagick Studio LLC, and found in the Wizard's Toolkit
'binaries' subdirectory of Wizard's Toolkit ftp sites.  Those who
want to build the Wizard's Toolkit from source code should refer
to the file README.txt in the Wizard's Toolkit source package or
https://urban-warrior.org/WizardsToolkit/WizardsToolkit/script/install-source.php
on the web.

Unix/Linux/Darwin/Cygwin/MinGW Install:

  Download the appropriate binary from

     https://download.imagemagick.org/WizardsToolkit/download/binaries

  Create (or choose) a directory to install the package into and change to that
  directory, for example:

     cd $HOME

  Extract the contents of the package using the command

     tar xf /path/to/package.tar.gz

  If the 'bin' subdirectory of the extracted package is not already in your
  executable search path, add it to your PATH environment variable.  For
  example

     export PATH; PATH="$HOME/WizardsToolkit-1.0.9/bin:$PATH"

  Set the WIZARD_HOME environment variable to the path where you extracted the
  Wizard's Toolkit files. For example

     export WIZARD_HOME="$HOME/WizardsToolkit-1.0.9"

  On Linux and Solaris machines set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable:

     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/WizardsToolkit-1.0.9/lib"

  On Mac OS X (Darwin) machines set the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable:

     export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/WizardsToolkit-1.0.9/lib"


  Additional Information

    Environment Variables:

     In addition to the WIZARD_HOME environment variable defined above, you may
     find these variables useful:

       WIZARD_TMPDIR           path to store temporary files
       LD_LIBRARY_PATH         path to libWizard.so and other libraries

    Configuration Files

      The Wizard's Toolkit depends on an number of external configuration files
      which include configure.xml and log.xml.  The Wizard's Toolkit searches
      for configuration files in the following order, and loads them if found:

          $WIZARD_CONFIGURE_PATH
          $WIZARD_HOME/etc/WizardsToolkit
          $WIZARD_HOME/share/WizardsToolkit-1.0.9
          $HOME/.wizard/
          <client path>/etc/WizardsToolkit
          <current directory>/


XP, Win2K, WinME, NT, Win98, Win95 Install:

  Download

      https://download.imagemagick.org/WizardsToolkit/download/binaries/WizardsToolkit-1.0.9-windows-dll.exe

  and execute it (or "open" it from your browser) to start the installation
  program.
